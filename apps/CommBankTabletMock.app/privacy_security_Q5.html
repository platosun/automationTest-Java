<p>You can either go to Settings &gt; Registrations on another device you’re registered on to cancel your CommBank app registration, or call us on 13 2221.</p>
<p>The CommBank app is protected with either a four-digit PIN chosen by you during the registration process or by your NetBank password. In addition to this, we also recommend you also use the Passcode Lock feature on your tablet.</p>
<p>You should never disclose your PIN or NetBank password to anyone.</p>
<p>As an additional security measure, you should also consider the options available if your tablet is stolen or lost, such as the ability to remotely lock or wipe your tablet using Apple’s iCloud service.</p>
